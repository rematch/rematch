Plugins extend Rematch functionality. They are optional but very helpful. Below you can find a summary of plugins created by the Rematch team. You can also try searching in npm/github for plugins created by the community or create plugins yourself.

> If you can't find a plugin you need - you can always create one yourself. Head over to the [Plugins API](/docs/api-reference/plugins) for more details.

- [Immer Plugin](immer) - Wraps your reducers with immer, providing ability to safely do mutable changes resulting in immutable state.

- [Select Plugin](select) - Reselect selectors for Rematch models.

- [Persist Plugin](persist) - Redux persist wrapper.

- [Loading Plugin](loading) - Adds automated loading indicators for effects.

- [Updated Plugin](updated) - Simple time recorders for when models, effects or reducers were last triggered.
