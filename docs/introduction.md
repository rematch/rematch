> Rematch is Redux best practices without the boilerplate. No more action types, action creators, switch statements or thunks.

## Features

Redux is an amazing state management tool, supported by a healthy middleware ecosystem and excellent devtools.
Rematch builds upon Redux by reducing boilerplate and enforcing best practices. It provides the following features:

- Less than 2kb of size
- No configuration needed
- Reduces Redux boilerplate
- Built-in side-effects support
- [React Devtools](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-devtools) support
- TypeScript support
- Supports dynamically adding reducers
- Supports hot-reloading
- Allows to create multiple stores
- Supports React Native
- Extendable with plugins
- Many plugins available out of the box:
    - for persisting data with [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
    - for wrapping state with [immer.js](https://github.com/immerjs/immer)
    - for creating selectors with [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)
    - ...and others

## Migrate From Redux

Migrating from Redux to Rematch may only involve minor changes to your state management, and no necessary changes to your view logic. See the [migration reference](migrating-from-redux-to-rematch) for the details.

## Composable Plugins

Rematch and its internals are all built upon a plugin pipeline. As a result, developers can make complex custom plugins that modify the setup or add data models, often without requiring any changes to Rematch itself. See the [plugins](plugins/) developed by the Rematch team or the [API for creating plugins](api-reference/plugins).
