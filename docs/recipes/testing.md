:::tip
You can check our full suite of test of [@rematch/core](https://github.com/rematch/rematch/tree/main/packages/core/test) to check examples of how to test. We're using `jest` but they should work with any testing provider.

## Reducers

Testing with store.

```jsx
import { init } from "@rematch/core";
import myModel from "./myModel";

describe("myModel model", () => {
  it("reducer: my reducerName should do something", () => {
    const store = init({
      models: { myModel },
    });

    store.dispatch.myModel.reducerName(payload);

    const myModelData = store.getState().myModel;
    expect(myModelData).toBe("something");
  });
});
```

Testing reducers directly.

```jsx
import myModel from "./myModel";

describe("myModel model", () => {
  it("reducer: my reducerName should do something", () => {
    const result = myModel.reducers.reducerName(payload);
    expect(result).toBe("something");
  });
});
```

## Effects

Testing with store.

```jsx
import { init } from "@rematch/core";
import myModel from "./myModel";

describe("myModel model", () => {
  it("effect: my effectName should do something", async () => {
    const store = init({
      models: { myModel },
    });

    await store.dispatch.myModel.effectName(payload);

    const myModelData = store.getState().myModel;
    expect(myModelData).toBe("something");
  });
});
```

Testing effects directly.

```jsx
import myModel from "./myModel";

describe("myModel model", () => {
  it("effect: my effectName should do something", async () => {
    const reducerMockFn = jest.fn();

    // bind the functions you want to check
    await myModel.effects.effectName.call(
      { reducerThatIsGoingToBeCalled: reducerMockFn },
      payload
    );

    // checking if it was called
    expect(reducerMockFn).toHaveBeenCalled();

    // checking if it was called with the expected params
    expect(reducerMockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith("something");
  });
});
```
